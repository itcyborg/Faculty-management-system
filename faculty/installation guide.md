2. Open the folder, open system folder, open newdb.php file and in the constructor change fms to a name of your choice in the database(the db name must exist and must not contain any table).
3. Place the folder to your server home directory if you have not done so
4. Run install from your server. i.e localhost/{folder_name}/install.php
5. If you get a response, tables have been created successfully, then you are good to go.

7. Test the program by creating a forum, then load the index page again, and click on 'list forums'. If you see the forum you have created then, installation was successful.
8. Enjoy the program and share any errors experienced, ideas or comments.
